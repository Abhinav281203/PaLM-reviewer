# PaLM reviewer
 
A Python-based project that takes a Google Maps location link as input, scrapes the reviews associated with that place, and generates a summary of the reviews using Google AI's PaLM model. The goal is to provide insights into what people like and dislike about a particular location based on their reviews.
